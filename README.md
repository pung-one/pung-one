I'm an aspiring web developer who is passionate about accessibility and aesthetics. I believe that the web should be available to all users, regardless of their abilities, and I strive to create websites that are both beautiful and easy to use. I have experience working with the React framework and have recently been exploring the benefits of Next.js for building highly performant and SEO-friendly web applications. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as a deep understanding of accessibility best practices, I'm confident in my ability to create engaging and accessible user experiences for all.
